// JavaScript is a weakly typed language, meaning no explicit type assignment

// var (outdated)
var name = "name"

// let (recommended)
let hello = "hello"

// const (can't change the value after first initialization)
const test = "test"

// will give error because it is a const
// test = "updatevalue"

console.log(name)
console.log(hello)
console.log(test)
